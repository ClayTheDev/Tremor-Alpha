# Tremor
Hello everyone, I would like to introduce Tremor. Tremor is going to be a multipurpose minecraft server plugin that helps admins do their jobs, and allows players to do more in the game. 
**Upcoming**
- I plan on adding moderation tools for catching xrayers, hackers, etc.
- Party system: This would allow players to be more active in the server and to get rewards when a goal is met.
- Admin panel: The admin panel would have players on them that you can spectate, and a ban/kick module too.
